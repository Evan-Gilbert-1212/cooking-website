      My passion for cooking just started recently. For years I didn't care what
      I ate and just ate because I had to. Now, I have realized that I wanted to
      get more into cooking and making things that have more variety and that
      are healthier for me. I definitely want to be able to get better and learn
      how to make a wide variety of meals.

      I want to find dishes that are good, but also have plenty of protein and
      vegetables to make them balanced. So, my focus has been on finding recipes
      that have a good balance of everything. Not every meal will be perfect,
      but the more I think about what goes into the meal, the better off my
      cooking will be! So far, I have cooked the following dishes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Curry</li>
      <li>Green Chile Stew</li>
      <li>Chicken Enchiladas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I look forward to expanding this list and getting better at cooking all my
      favorite meals!
